Rules of Game:

To play, the player places their ante before any cards are shown. 
The player and house both receive 5 cards.
The player's 5 cards are shown, and only 1 of the house's cards are face up.
The player then has the option to play(bet) or fold.
Should the player choose to bet, the bet amount is fixed to two times their ante (example ante $100, bet $200, total wager $300)
If the player folds, they forfeit their initial ante.
After the player either plays(bets) or folds, the house then reveals their remaining 4 cards. 
The house only qualifies if their hand contains either a King & Ace, or forms a higher rated poker hand (pair, two pair, triple, â€¦., royal flush).
The two hands are then compared, if the house is stronger, the player loses. If the player and house have the same hand, they tie and both ante as well as bets are pushed. Should the player hand be stronger than the house hand, the player wins their wager multiplied by the payoff. 
If the house doesn't qualify and the player has a stronger hand, the player will only get even money for their ante.
